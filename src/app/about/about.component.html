                  <h2>Our Vision: Tiny Homes, Big Impact</h2>
                  <p>At Grannyflats, we believe in the power of tiny homes to create meaningful change. Our
                      mission is
                      to provide innovative, sustainable, and affordable housing solutions that inspire and
                      empower
                      people to live more intentionally.</p>
                  <p>Grannyflats was founded by a team of passionate builders, designers, and environmental
                      advocates
                      who share a common goal to revolutionize the way we think about living spaces. With years of
                      experience in the construction and design industries, we bring a wealth of knowledge and
                      expertise to every project.</p>
